## Welcome!
Visu is a component library and design system developed for Coaktion products.
Use the browser sidebar to chose between Visu components and test them using the Storybook playground

## Important
Before create/modify a component story *ALWAYS* build Visu and run _npm install_ to update Storybook dependencies (specially Visu)
 
## Installing
Install the library in a React project with the command _npm i @droz-js/visu_

## Configuration
Visu is built using Tailwind CSS as a basis for styling components, making it work in different environments. Based on this, there are 2 ways to install Visu to your project

- ### Project *WITH* Tailwindcss
To use in projects **WITH** Tailwindcss it is necessary to import the styling of _@droz-js/visu/dist/theme-plugin_ as a **plugin** and _@droz-js/visu/dist/visu.es.js_ needs to be added to **content** in your _tailwind.config.js_ file.

- ### Project *WITHOUT* Tailwindcss
To use in projects **WITHOUT** Tailwindcss, you need to import the styling from _@droz-js/visu/styles_ into your global styles file.

## Using
Once the library is configured, simply import a component and add it to the project.
